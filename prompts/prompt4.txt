<description>
An ASCII table with tab-separated columns: Supernova Name, Redshift, Distance Modulus, and Distance Modulus Error. For Union2.1, there is an additional column for the probability that the supernova was hosted by a low-mass galaxy.

Fit this data within flat LCDM model with two free parameters: H0 and Omega_L. Write a simple MCMC (but optimized/fast) code to fit for H0 and Î©_L using the SN1a data.
Make a contour plot and show the 1d posteriors, and quote the mean and 1-sigma on each parameter.
Finally show the data along with the best fit model and 68%/95% CL regions.
Comment on the results.

Constraints:
We are running this analysis on a Ubuntu with 8 available threads. Ensure you use the resources optimally so the MCMC can run fast, i.e., within a few minutes until convergence.
